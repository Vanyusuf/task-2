                        A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for
                        her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of
                        fighting and struggling. It seemed that as one problem was solved, a new a arose.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high
                        fire. Soon the pots came to a boil. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed
                        eggs, and the last she placed ground coffe beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a
                        word.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them
                        in a bowl. She then pulled the egg out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladied the coffee out
                        and placed it in a bowl.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me, what do you see?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft.
                        She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the
                        hardboiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled as she tasted its
                        rich aroma.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        The daughter then asked, "What does it mean, Mother?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-info">
                        Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity -- boiling water--
                        but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard and unrelenting. However, after
                        being subjected in the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its
                        this outer shell had protected in liquid interior. But, after sitting through the boiling water,
                        its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the
                        boiling water, they had changed the water.
